Uni Life is a web-based platform developed to support international students in the UK, with the primary aim of simplifying their transition to university life. As international students often face numerous challenges, ranging from navigating new environments to managing finances and adjusting to university culture, Uni Life provides a comprehensive, user-friendly solution that helps ease their adjustment. The platform aims to foster confidence, connection, and support by offering a variety of tools and resources designed to enhance the overall student experience. This project is expected to be completed in eight weeks, during which the platform will be built, tested, and launched to meet the specific needs of its users.
